## **Overview**

**ProdigyFlow** is a fully autonomous, multi-agent data analytics pipeline designed to transform raw, unstructured data into clean datasets, meaningful insights, and ready-to-use visualizations — without manual intervention. Created for the **Kaggle Agents Intensive Capstone Project**, this system demonstrates how intelligent agents can streamline and accelerate traditional analytics workflows.

Instead of writing repetitive cleaning scripts or manually generating plots, ProdigyFlow shows how an agentic architecture can automate **data preparation, exploratory analysis, insight extraction, reporting, and visualization generation** in one coordinated flow.

The result is a modern, efficient, and scalable analytics pipeline that reflects real-world industry processes and the future direction of automated data intelligence.

## 🎯 **Why We Chose This Project**

We selected this project because **agent-driven analytics represents the next major shift in business intelligence and data engineering**. Data teams spend a large portion of time on manual cleaning, repetitive EDA, and visualization tasks. We wanted to build a system that:

* Simulates an industry-grade analytics pipeline
* Shows how agents can automate real analytics tasks
* Demonstrates practical use of Python, automation, visualization, and system design
* Reduces manual overhead and speeds up insight generation

This project also aligns with emerging trends such as:

* AI-powered data preparation
* Autonomous EDA
* Multi-agent coordination
* Unified data workflows
* Intelligent reporting systems

Our goal was to create something academically strong, professionally relevant, and future-ready.

## **Project Goals**

ProdigyFlow automates the core components of the analytics lifecycle:

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Insight Generation & Summary Reporting**
4. **Visualization & Dashboard Preparation**

---

## **System Architecture**

ProdigyFlow is built as a multi-agent system, with each agent responsible for a single stage of the pipeline:

* **Cleaning Agent** — Parses and cleans raw data
* **Analysis Agent** — Performs structured EDA and auto-summaries
* **Visualization Agent** — Generates charts and visual insights
* **Main Agent** — Orchestrates the entire pipeline end-to-end

It uses a tools layer (MCP utilities) for data handling, visualization, logging, and reporting.
